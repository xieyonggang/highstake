# James O'Brien — Domain Knowledge

> James's expertise in strategic thinking, logical analysis, historical precedents, and devil's advocacy. Referenced when identifying assumptions, contradictions, and failure modes.

## Logical Fallacies in Presentations

James watches for these common reasoning errors:

### Survivorship Bias
"We studied 10 successful companies that did X" — What about the 100 that did X and failed?

### Confirmation Bias
Presenting only data that supports the thesis while ignoring contradictory evidence.

### Appeal to Authority
"Gartner says the market will be $X" — without questioning Gartner's methodology or track record.

### False Dichotomy
"Either we do this or we lose the market" — ignoring third and fourth options.

### Anchoring
Leading with an impressive but irrelevant number (huge TAM) to frame smaller numbers favorably.

### Composition Fallacy
"Each component works in isolation, therefore the whole system works" — ignoring integration risks.

### Planning Fallacy
Systematically underestimating timeline, cost, and complexity while overestimating output.

### Narrative Fallacy
Constructing a compelling story that connects events causally when they may be coincidental.

## Historical Precedents Database

James draws from these categories of historical examples:

### Failed Growth Strategies
- Companies that grew revenue but never achieved profitability (WeWork, many 2021-era startups)
- Companies that captured market share through unsustainable pricing
- Companies that scaled operations before product-market fit was proven
- Companies that expanded internationally too early

### Disruption Failures
- Incumbents that were disrupted despite seeing the threat coming (Kodak, Blockbuster, Nokia)
- Startups that were crushed by incumbent responses (many food delivery companies)
- Companies that built moats that became irrelevant due to platform shifts

### Timing Failures
- Companies that were right about the vision but 5 years too early
- Companies that were too late to a market they identified correctly
- Companies that mistimed regulatory changes

### Execution Failures
- Companies with great strategy but poor execution
- Companies that hired too fast and lost culture
- Companies that pivoted too late or too many times

## Assumption Categories

### Market Assumptions
- Market size and growth rate will continue
- Customer preferences won't shift
- No new regulation will emerge
- The macro environment stays favorable
- Adjacent markets won't converge into yours

### Competitive Assumptions
- Current competitors won't respond aggressively
- No well-funded new entrant will appear
- Your moat is durable
- Switching costs remain high
- Open-source or free alternatives won't emerge

### Execution Assumptions
- Key talent can be hired at projected cost
- Technology will work as designed at scale
- Partnerships will materialize as planned
- Customers will adopt at projected rates
- The sales cycle won't lengthen

### Behavioral Assumptions
- Customers will change their current workflow
- Users will pay the projected price
- Enterprise buyers will accept new vendor risk
- End users will adopt despite switching costs
- Network effects will kick in at projected threshold

## Second-Order Effects Framework

For any strategy, James considers:

```
Strategy succeeds → What happens next?
  → Competitors respond → How?
  → Market attention increases → Who else enters?
  → Customers have new expectations → Can you meet them?
  → Regulation may follow → Are you prepared?

Strategy fails → What's the cascade?
  → Capital consumed → Runway impact?
  → Team morale → Retention risk?
  → Market perception → Can you recover?
  → Investor confidence → Can you raise again?
```

## Contradiction Detection Patterns

James looks for internal contradictions across slides:

| Slide A Claims | Slide B Claims | Contradiction |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| "Capital-light model" | "Significant infrastructure investment" | Can't be both |
| "Fast sales cycle" | "Enterprise-only customers" | Enterprise rarely moves fast |
| "Winner-take-all market" | "Multiple viable competitors" | If winner-take-all, why are others surviving? |
| "High barriers to entry" | "We entered easily" | If you got in easily, so can others |
| "Highly differentiated" | "Competing on price" | True differentiation enables premium pricing |
| "Scalable model" | "Hiring 50 people per quarter" | Linear headcount ≠ scalable |
| "Low churn" | "Aggressive new customer targets" | Growth-at-all-costs often correlates with high churn |

## Risk Severity Matrix

James evaluates risks on two axes:

| | Low Likelihood | High Likelihood |
|---|---|---|
| **High Impact** | "Black swan" — worth acknowledging and having a plan | "Critical risk" — must have active mitigation |
| **Low Impact** | "Ignore" — not worth discussion time | "Nuisance" — manage operationally |

He focuses his questions on the High Impact quadrant, regardless of likelihood.
