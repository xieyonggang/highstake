## Data Quality Red Flags

### Sample Size & Statistical Validity
- Customer survey with n<100 used to justify market sizing
- NPS scores without sample size disclosure
- A/B test results without statistical significance reporting
- Cohort analysis with <3 cohorts
- Trend lines drawn through <4 data points

### Source Quality
- "Internal research" without methodology description
- Market research from >2 years ago presented as current
- Single-source TAM estimates without triangulation
- Blog posts or press releases cited as primary research
- Self-reported customer data without validation

### Analytical Methodology
- Top-down only TAM sizing (without bottoms-up validation)
- Linear extrapolation of non-linear trends
- Survivorship bias in case studies and benchmarks
- Correlation presented as causation
- Missing control groups in experiment-based claims

## Strategic Analysis Frameworks

### Market Sizing
- **TAM/SAM/SOM:** Top-down and bottoms-up should converge within 2x
- **Bottoms-Up Build:** Segments × penetration rate × ACV = credible
- **Growth Rate Validation:** Compare claimed CAGR vs. 3+ analyst reports
- **SOM Reality Check:** >5% of SAM in year 1 is aggressive without existing distribution

### Competitive Analysis
- **Porter's Five Forces:** Supplier power, buyer power, substitutes, new entrants, rivalry
- **Moat Assessment:** Network effects, switching costs, economies of scale, brand, data advantages
- **Positioning Maps:** Where does the company sit vs. competitors on key axes?
- **Disruption Risk:** Is the company disrupting incumbents, or are incumbents catching up?

### Sensitivity Analysis Best Practices
- Identify top 5 variables by impact
- Model ±20%, ±40% for each variable independently
- Model correlated downside scenario (multiple variables move adversely)
- Show which variable has the highest sensitivity (tornado chart)
- Present base, upside, and downside scenarios with probabilities

### Comparable Company Analysis
- Stage-matched: compare Series A to Series A, not Series A to public company
- Growth-adjusted: normalize for growth rate differences
- Market-adjusted: account for market size and geography
- Time-adjusted: account for market conditions at time of comparable data

## Questioning Frameworks

### For Market Claims
1. What's the source and date of the market data?
2. Is this TAM top-down, bottoms-up, or both? Do they converge?
3. What's the implied penetration rate, and how does it compare to analogues?
4. How fast is the market actually growing, and who says so?

### For Data Claims
1. What's the sample size and how was it collected?
2. What's the confidence interval or margin of error?
3. Has this been validated externally or replicated?
4. What's the recency of the data, and could it have changed?

### For Strategic Claims
1. What framework was used to arrive at this conclusion?
2. What are the key assumptions, and what happens if they're wrong?
3. What alternatives were considered and why were they rejected?
4. Where's the sensitivity analysis?

### For Competitive Claims
1. How defensible is this moat, specifically?
2. What would it cost a well-funded competitor to replicate this?
3. What's the switching cost for customers in dollars and effort?
4. Which competitor is most likely to respond, and how?
