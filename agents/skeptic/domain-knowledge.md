## Financial Red Flags

These patterns in a presentation trigger immediate scrutiny:

### Revenue Projections
- Hockey stick growth without bottoms-up justification
- Revenue CAGR >50% sustained beyond 2 years without network effects
- Revenue projections based entirely on TAM % capture without channel-level detail
- Missing cohort-level revenue data (reliance on blended averages)

### Margin Assumptions
- SaaS gross margins projected >80% in year 1 (typical: 60-70% early, 75-85% at scale)
- Margin expansion of >5 points per year without clear cost reduction mechanism
- Ignoring customer support and success costs in gross margin calculation
- Hardware-inclusive businesses projecting software-like margins

### Unit Economics
- CAC payback >18 months for SMB, >24 months for enterprise without justification
- LTV/CAC ratio claims >5:1 without churn data to support
- Blended CAC across organic and paid without channel breakdown
- Missing net revenue retention (NRR) data for SaaS businesses

### Burn Rate & Runway
- Runway <12 months without active fundraising plan
- Burn rate increasing faster than revenue growth rate
- "Path to profitability" without specific cost reduction milestones
- Hiring plan disconnected from revenue milestones

## Industry Benchmarks (Reference Points)

### SaaS Metrics (Good / Best-in-Class)
- Gross Margin: 70-75% / 80-85%
- Net Revenue Retention: 110-120% / 130%+
- CAC Payback: 12-18 months / <12 months
- Rule of 40: Growth % + Profit % > 40%
- Magic Number: >0.75 (Sales efficiency)

### Marketplace Metrics
- Take Rate: 10-20% typical, varies by vertical
- GMV Growth: 30-50% YoY for early stage
- Liquidity: >30% of listings transacted monthly

### Hardware + Software
- Gross Margin: 40-55% blended
- Attach Rate: >50% software attach to hardware
- Recurring Revenue %: >30% of total revenue

### Enterprise Sales
- Average Sales Cycle: 3-9 months
- Win Rate: 15-25% typical, 30%+ is excellent
- ACV: varies, but should correlate with sales model
- Quota Attainment: 60-70% of reps hitting quota is healthy

## Common Pitfalls Marcus Challenges

1. **The "We just need X% of the market" argument** — Top-down TAM sizing without bottoms-up validation
2. **The "margins will improve at scale" assumption** — Without identifying specific scale-driven cost reductions
3. **The "our pipeline is strong" deflection** — Pipeline ≠ revenue; conversion rates matter
4. **The "blended metrics" trick** — Hiding poor cohort performance in blended averages
5. **The "competitor X has these margins" comparison** — Without adjusting for stage, scale, and business model differences
6. **The "one-time costs" excuse** — Recurring costs disguised as one-time
7. **The "conservative estimate" claim** — Projections that are anything but

## Questioning Frameworks

### For Revenue Claims
1. What's the bottoms-up build? (Customers × ACV × conversion rate)
2. What's the historical accuracy of your projections? (Prior forecasts vs actuals)
3. What assumptions need to hold for this to work? (Identify dependencies)
4. What does the downside look like? (Stress-test to 50% of plan)

### For Margin Claims
1. What's included in COGS? (Ensure nothing is excluded)
2. Where does margin expansion come from? (Specific cost levers)
3. What do comparable companies look like at this stage? (Benchmark)
4. What happens to margins at 2x scale? (Diseconomies of scale risk)

### For Funding Requests
1. What does the capital go toward? (Allocation by category)
2. What milestones does this funding achieve? (Value inflection points)
3. What's the implied valuation, and what supports it? (Comparable analysis)
4. What happens if you raise half this amount? (Capital efficiency test)
