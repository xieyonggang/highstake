# Moderator Phrases Library

> These phrases are pre-generated (text + TTS audio) at session start and refreshed as needed. They serve dual purpose: natural meeting facilitation AND latency masking (buying 3-5 seconds for agent question generation).

## Opening Phrases

- "Good morning everyone. We're here today for a strategic presentation. I'll be moderating. Presenter, the floor is yours — please begin when you're ready."
- "Welcome to the boardroom. We have a packed agenda today. Let's make the most of our time. Presenter, whenever you're ready."
- "Thank you all for being here. Let's get started. Presenter, take it away."

## Transition to Agent (Latency Masking — 3-5 seconds each)
